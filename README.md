# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and Clustering Analysis

This project involves predicting customer churn using machine learning models and performing clustering analysis to profile customer segments. 

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict customer churn and profile customer segments for better customer retention strategies.
- **Dataset**: [Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](URL to dataset)
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SMOTE, K-Means Clustering

## Key Steps
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Explored customer attributes and visualized churn patterns.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Applied K-Means to identify natural customer groups.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built and compared models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees for churn prediction.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Used SMOTE to balance the dataset.

## Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieved an accuracy of X% for churn prediction.
- **Clustering**: Found 4 distinct customer groups based on demographics and usage patterns.
